## Updating pages

This project uses [Slate](https://github.com/lord/slate) for building the documentation pages.

Follow [Slate readme](https://github.com/lord/slate/blob/master/README.md) and [wiki](https://github.com/lord/slate/wiki) for instructions on how to edit files and make changes.

## Deploying an update 

To install locally use:

```shell
bundle install
```

> **Important note:** if you run into `bundle install` errors, you may need to install `ruby-devel` and install the related gems again to build native extensions.  

Then, to test changes locally run:

```shell
bundle exec middleman server
```

Finally, after pushing changes and you are ready to deploy use the script:

```shell
bash deploy.sh
```
